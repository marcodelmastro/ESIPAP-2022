# ESIPAP 2022 - Experimental Particle Physics

## Slides

The slides presenting the exercises (calculations, discussions, ...) we will do during the tutorials the will appear in [this directory](Slides) as the in-person course proceeds.
You should already have access to the lectures' slides, alonside with the lectures' recordings you should watch before the in-person courses.

## Homework

I will give you things to do by yourself, either alone or in small groups, in order to consolidate what you learned during the lectures and the tutorials. 
Instructions and material will appear in the [Homework](Homework) directory.

## Tutorials

Every once in a while, we will do simple calculations and data analysis exercises. 
We will use [ROOT](https://root.cern) and [Python](https://www.python.org) with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks, that will appear in the [Tutorials](Tutorials) directory. 

You have several options to run these notebooks:

- You already have a local setup version of Python3 and ROOT (with Python support enabled) installed on your computer: clone or download the repository, and run the notebooks locally.

- You have a CERN account, and you know how to use [SWAN](http://swan.cern.ch): clone the repository on your CERNBox area to access and run the notebooks.

- You would like to run Python and ROOT on your computer, but you don't have them installed and you are not sure about how to properly do it. In this case, the safest option is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com), and to use the container that already have the proper setup. Here's is a quick list of instructions:

   * Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for you OS;

   * Once done, make sure you can run the `docker` command from a terminal;

   * Clone or download the ESIPAP-2022 repository (this one!) somewhere to your disk;

   * From the command line, run the command:  
     \
     `docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 --name ESIPAP marcodelmastro/esipap:ESIPAP-2022`  
	 \
     This will start the ESIPAP container.
	 You should see on the screen a series of messages, including one with a `http` address similar to this (**the token string will be different!**):  
	 \
     `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=5666c2fc6015b0e0310382076f31ad9df7f2afc2694090ff`

   * Copy and paste the address in your browser, and you should land on a page like this one:  
     ![ROOT Notebook browser](browser.png)

   * Note that if you use the procedure described above, **every change you make to the notebook will be lost when you stop the container!**. 
     This is because docker will serve you the notebook from the container, and you don't have the right to save them. 
	 In other to keep your changes run instead this command:  
	 \
     `docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v <location-of-the-ESIPAP-repo>:/home/esipap/local --name ESIPAP marcodelmastro/esipap:ESIPAP-2022`  
	 \
	 where `<location-of-the-ESIPAP-repo>` is the path to where you downloaded the ESIPAP repository. For instance, on a Unix machin is could be:  
	 \
	 `docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v /Users/Marco/ESIPAP-2022:/home/esipap/local --name ESIPAP marcodelmastro/esipap:ESIPAP-2022`  
	 \
	 or, on a Windows machine, something like:  
	 \
	 `docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v  C:\Users\Marco\ESIPAP-2022:/home/esipap/local --name ESIPAP marcodelmastro/esipap:ESIPAP-2022`  
	 \
	 On a Unix machine you could also `cd` to the repository and use the `pwd` command like:  
	 \
	 `docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v  $(pwd):/home/esipap/local --name ESIPAP marcodelmastro/esipap:ESIPAP-2022`  
	 \
	 In all these cases, when you open the notebook server windowd you should see something like:  
	 ![ROOT Notebook browser](browser_local.png)
	 **Note the `local` directory:** if you open it, you'll browse the repository on your disk (and not that in the container), and all changes you make to the notebooks, or any new notebook you create, will be saved on your disk.

- If none of the above works for you, you can launch a standalone [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org) environment using the other button below: it will give you a working setup with Python and ROOT, that will allow you to run the notebooks from the browser. Please note that in this case any change you make will be lost unless you copy them elsewhere.

**Go to the [Tutorials](Tutorials) directory and execute the [example notebook](Tutorials/TestSetup.ipynb) there to verify your setup!**

If you never used Python before, fear not! It's rather easy to get the grip of the basics. You can use the excellent [Crash Course](https://github.com/rpmuller/PythonCrashCourse) by [Rick Muller](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~rmuller/) to get started.
